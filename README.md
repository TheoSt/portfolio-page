# Theodore Stamatiadis Portfolio page
Here is the code of my Portfolio page i designed! I really like the modern design and its simplicity. I think that portfolios must be easy and quick to use, because so many people will see it.

I chose 5 of my best projects so far to show them on the page, and decided to make a 3D rotation of each project section. The front section has an image of the project and the back section has the title,some info and links to code and demo.I think i saved a lot of content space with this idea!

Also i put the tech stack i use/'ve used, with a nice 3D carousel, an about me section with a funny aspect of me and of course my contact details.
